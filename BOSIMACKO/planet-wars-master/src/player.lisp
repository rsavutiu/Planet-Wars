;;;; Move generation
;;;;
;;;; A `step' is a set of orders from the same player targeting the
;;;; same planet. The constituent orders need not be for the same
;;;; turn, neither do they need to arrive on the same turn.
;;;;
;;;; A `move' is a set of orders from the same player without any
;;;; restriction. That includes future orders too.
;;;;
;;;; Move generation first computes so called step targets. A `step
;;;; target' is a ship count vector over turns representing the
;;;; desired arrivals.
;;;;
;;;; For each step target a number of steps can be found that produce
;;;; the desired arrivals. In the current implementation there is a
;;;; single step generated (see FIND-STEPS).
;;;;
;;;; Once we have the steps we want to combine them into moves. Not
;;;; all combinations are valid, but the number is combinations can be
;;;; huge. To limit the number of moves generated we first evaluate
;;;; steps one by one, sort them in descending order of evaluation
;;;; score and try to combine them starting from the first. For
;;;; details see GENERATE-MOVES-FROM-STEPS.
